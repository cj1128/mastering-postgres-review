## About Python Code

first create virtual env under `~/Documents/python/envs`.

```bash
python3 -m venv ~/Documents/python/envs/mastering-pg
```

then activate virtual env. if `direnv` has been installed, virtual env will be automaticaly activated when enters the root directory.

```bash
$ source ~/Documents/python/envs/mastering-pg/bin/activate
```

## Quotes

> If you want to use stored procedures, please always write them in SQL, and only switch to PLpgSQL when necessary. If you want to be efficient, the default should be SQL. -- page 42

> The SQL writing process is mainly about discovery. In SQL you need to explain your problem, unlike in most programming languages where you need to focus on a solution you think is going to solve your problem. Thatâ€™s quite different and requires looking at your problem in another way and understanding it well enough to be able to express it in details in a single sentence. -- page 86

## 1. Preface

## 2. Introduction

### A First Use Case

- `load-data.sql`: load tsv data to postgres

  use `\copy` command.

- `select-february.sql`: select records of specific date range, e.g. february 2017

  use `date` and `interval` function to manipulate date.

  use `to_char` function to format numbers.

- `select-full-february.sql`: show records of every day of february 2017, if not present, use zero

  use `generate_series` to generate a date range.

- `add-wow.sql`: add a column *wow* to show dollars difference between current day and previous week

  use `lag` window function.

## 3. Writing SQL Queries

### Business Logic

- `artist-album-duration.sql`: display the list of albums from a given artist, each with its total duration

  use `interval` data type, remember to set `intervalstyle` to `postgres_verbose`.

- `artist-album-duration.py`: use python to do the same thing as above.

- `sp_get-all-albums.sql`: stored procedure to do the same thing as above.

- `four-albums.sql`: display albums and durations from artists who only have 4 albums

  use `lateral` sub queries and stored procedure.

### A Small Application

- `load-data.sql`: use `pgloader` to load sqlite data to pg

- `top-artists-by-album`: list top n artists ordered by album count

- `top-artists-by-genre`: list top n artists by genre

  use `lateral` join.

### The SQL REPL - An Interactive Setup

- `get-database-size.sql`: user postgres `pg_database` to get name and size of all databases

### SQL is Code

- `tracks-named-after-artists`: find out tracks being named after another artists

## 4. SQL Toolbox

### Get Some Data

- `loda-data.sql`: creat tables and load data to `f1db` database. Data was downloaded from http://ergast.com/mrd/db/.

  ```bash
  $ createdb f1db
  $ psql -d f1db < load_data.sql
  ```

### Select, From, Where

- `date-calc.sql`: use PG to do some date calcs

- `top-drivers.sql`: get top 3 drivers

- `race-and-winner.sql`: list races and their winners of a period of time

- `unlucky-drivers.sql`: list drivers who did not finish the race of some season
